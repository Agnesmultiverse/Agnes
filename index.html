            </strong>
            <p>
                Agnes exists in many forms—each one a solitary star, yet together they paint the sky of Asian women’s stories, luminous and fierce.
                In one universe, she runs toward adulthood, only to collide with its sharp edges, the weight of expectations pressing her down. In
                another, she gazes into mirrors that warp her reflection, her heart heavy with the burden of beauty’s impossible standards. In yet
                another universe, Agnes has already passed away. Her family holds a grand traditional Chinese funeral for her, burning paper money,
                gold, and jewelry as if she can still receive these riches in the afterlife. However, from heaven, Agnes pens a calm yet melancholic
                letter, ironically pointing out that this funeral was never truly for her—it is a show for the living, a performance to comfort them,
                and to display their filial piety and status. In another life, Agnes hides behind the chaos of binge eating, while in yet another world,
                she stitches dreams into fabric, crafting a brand that honors women’s bodies as they are—real, unapologetic, and whole. These Agneses do
                not know each other, yet their struggles echo across universes. They carry the scars and the strength of a shared existence, navigating
                worlds that see only fragments of who they are. Each Agnes is both an individual and a collective voice, a symphony of resilience,
                vulnerability, and the quiet rebellion to be seen as they truly are. Step into their worlds. Let their stories wash over you, like waves
                from distant shores, each one telling of a different battle, a different dream. Here, in this multiverse, every Agnes is a reflection of the other.
            </p>
            <strong class="highlight">
                And within each reflection, there is a piece of every Asian woman. Because in these infinite worlds, Agnes is all of us. And we are all Agnes.
