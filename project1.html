            <p>
                <span>Dear family and friends,</span> 
    
                <span>I write this letter from heaven, where every day I am “surrounded” by the paper money, gold, and jewelry you burn for me. The paper mansions, cars, and servants arrive in flames, supposedly to ensure I live a prosperous life here in the afterlife.</span> 
    
                <span>I see you gathered around my altar, placing fruits, dishes, and cups of wine, lighting candles and incense as if I were still at the table with you. Each time you refill the cups, I can almost hear the sound of your lips pursing into polite smiles for the neighbors, as if saying, “Look at how well our Agnes is being taken care of, even in death. Our filial piety is unmatched.”</span> 
    
                <span>But do you know the truth? Here in heaven, I need none of this. The piles of paper money will never become real wealth in this void, and the burning candles won’t warm my spirit. All that you do is, in fact, nothing to do with me. This grand funeral was never truly for me.</span> 
    
                <span>I am merely the backdrop in this performance. The real protagonists are you—the children eager to prove their devotion, the parents keen to show their family’s status, and the descendants hoping the whole village knows how “successful” they’ve become. I can hear the neighbors whisper, “Their kids must be doing so well.” “Look, what a filial family, they’ve sent so much to Agnes.” Through this ceremony, you’re rebuilding your social standing, using my death to bolster your pride in life.</span> 
    
                <span>I watch it all from here—the music, the rituals, every carefully executed gesture—and all I feel is a cold sense of detachment. Death, which should have been my final rest, has become your lively social event. Each time the flames rise, I see not a gesture of remembrance, but your fear of judgment and your obsession with external validation.</span> 
    
                <span>You, the living, busy yourselves creating a refuge for your own hearts, but you do so at my expense. Did anyone stop to think if I truly needed all this paper wealth and this ostentatious farewell? Perhaps all I ever wanted was a moment of quiet, a few words of sincere remembrance.</span> 
    
                <span>But I know that won’t happen. In this world, funerals were never meant for the dead.</span> 
    
                <span>Farewell, Agnes</span>
            </p>
